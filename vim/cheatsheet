yank lines 
-----------
:364,757yEnter

if you want to copy those lines and paste to some certain line, t is your friend. for example:

:364,757t2Enter will copy those lines to under 2nd line.

~ up/lower case under cursor


File Paths
-----------
CTRL+G
:pwd
:cd
:lcd
:set autochdir 


CTRL+R
-----------
While in insert mode, you can use Ctrl-R {register}, where register can be:

    + for the clipboard,
    * for the X clipboard (last selected text in X),
    " for the unnamed register (last delete or yank in Vim),
    or a number of others (see :h registers).

Ctrl-R {register} inserts the text as if it were typed.
Ctrl-R Ctrl-O {register} inserts the text with the original indentation.
Ctrl-R Ctrl-P {register} inserts the text and auto-indents it.
Ctrl-O can be used to run any normal mode command before returning to insert mode, so
Ctrl-O "+p can also be used, for example.

For more information, view the documentation with :h i_ctrl-r
